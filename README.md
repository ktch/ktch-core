# the Kitchen - Core Values (v0.9)

## Grit: Everything is Possible

We keep a positive attitude, and we acknowledge the world is boundless possibility. We never give up. The only force standing in the way of a perfect solution to any problem is lack of will.

We grind with devastating tenacity to overcome doubts and obstacles and to defeat our enemies.

## Craft: Quality and Perfection

The purpose of existence is to make the world better, and what we put out into the world is a reflection of ourselves. We strive to perfect our craft. We spend a significant portion of our lives working, and to not have pride in our product would be a tragedy.

Our work _delights_ our customers, and hopefully, it also delights us.

Long story short: We care.

## Value: Profit and Growth

Profit isn't only about making money. It's about increasing the value of everything we touch. In fact, _even "making money" isn't really about money_. Financial gain is just one indicator of generated value.

In everything we do, every single person and entity in the process _must_ profit: from our company, to our customer, to our staff, to a location where we film.

Growth is a reflection of our value and its only purpose is to drive even greater value.

## Intuition: Freedom and Creativity

In order to have full access to the Universal and Magical Ocean of Solutions, we defend our absolute freedom to try things, to say things, to fight for things, and to feel things.

We are open to all ideas. We will not be afraid of failure or anything else. We play with toys, tap on keys, put pencil to paper, and dance in circles, because it is our nature, and we do not know where the answer will come from.

In the end, we trust our gut, and we do what feels best.

## Harmony: Teamwork, Humility, and Grace

On the piano, the ability to play different notes together expands the array of possible tones from twelve to nine thousand.

A good idea is only a single key. It is the hundreds of supporting ideas that can turn it into _an actual thing that is good_. Only a great _team_ can generate the ten thousand ideas, experiences, and passions it would take to make a single good idea into something truly _great_.

In everything we do, we support our teammates, we recognize our own limitations, we lean on the strengths of others, and we tirelessly challenge one another to be the best we can be.
